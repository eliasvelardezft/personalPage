    <h1>Elias Velardez</h1>
    <h2>Software Developer</h2>
    <p class="not-h1">
      Hi! I'm Elias. I'm a Systems Engineering Student, currently in the third year.
      I'm twenty years old and I'm from Argentina.
      I really enjoy coding and learning to code, not only because I want to be able to make a living out of it but I also like doing it in my free time, its really fun for me!
      I like to learn everything that comes into my path, but my main interest is in the backend side of things (as you can tell from this webpage's design).
      I'm very interested in backend web development. Also, I like the data analysis field and I'm eager to dive more into it and the different branches related.
      I consider myself to be a fast-learner and I really love learning new stuff, so I'll be happy to learn anything that you throw at me.
      As well, I enjoy teamwork as there's no limit to what you can learn from other people's perspectives.
    </p>

      <h2>Backend</h2>
      <p>
        My main interest is in the backend side of life. <br>
        Python is one of the languages I like the most
        and lately I've been deepening my knowledge in django for a project I'm working on at my current job. <br>
        I also have knowledge in Databases (PostgreSQL and MSSQL), 
        oriented essentially towards the data analysis sector, 
        as I love the possibility of answering specific and relevant questions from data.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Python</li>
        <li>Django</li>
        <li>Django Rest Framework</li>
        <li>PostgreSQL</li>
        <li>SQL Server</li>
      </ul>
  
      <h2>Frontend</h2>
      <p>
        Although I want to focus on backend development, 
        recently I've been learning a lot about JavaScript. 
        It's a language I feel very comfortable with
        and I really enjoy using it to solve problems and algorithms to build dynamic websites.
        Besides that, I also started learning about Tailwind CSS, 
        and even though I don't get along very well with building layouts, 
        I find it an amazing tool to do it.
        Also, I started using webpack to implement modules in my projects.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>JavaScript</li>
        <li>Webpack</li>
        <li>HTML</li>
        <li>CSS</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS</li>
      </ul>
